The general concept for this assignment was to do research into a test company's request for code.
Take the keywords from the request and break it down into simple to understand concepts.
Once an understanding of the idea is found, begin formalizing an approach to building the concept in the way of code. A "story" or "vision".
The code itself was to build a program that can take in commands from a computer and move an acuator within a simulated space.
It would take into account different properties that would be viewing the actuator, affecting it, or being reacted by its action.
This was to all be done in a fabricated group setting as though we were real coders working in a group on a client's project.
My group consisted of 3 people including myself.

The file that contains all the code my group worked on for this assignment is located in the parser.java file.
