Project 
General concept for this assignment was to do research into a test company's request for code.
Take the keywords from the request and break it down into simple to understand concepts.
Once an understanding of the idea is found, begin formalizing an approach to building the concept in the way of code. A "story" or "vision".
The code itself was to build a program that can take in commands from a computer and move an acuator within a simulated space.
It would take into account different properties that would be viewing the actuator, affecting it, or being reacted by its action.
